# CS210-CpluplusProjects

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project integrates Java and C++ code and allows the user to create and maintain a list of animals in a zoo.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I set up the inheritance of the parent classes and subclasses in C++ well.  I also think I handled the formatting of the data and the formatting of the output fairly well.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could enhance the verification of user input in my code to check for valid entries of data.  I could also potentially add a loop to go back to the main menu if an incorrect entry was made by the user.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The main challenge I faced was just initially understanding what the Java code was doing and figuring out the best way to use C++ code in conjunction with it.  It was also challenging to make the formatting of the user input in C++ match the formatting of the Java inputs.  The main resource I used was cplusplus.com.  I don't think I could have done this project without going to this website multiple times.  The instructor and the textbook for this course were also very helpful and provided me with good guidance to get me started.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The main skill I learned from this project is that it is possible to integrate multiple languages and it's important to recognize when this might be useful to do.  This is a way to take advantage of the best features of multiple languages and use them together.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I heavily commented my code for readability (maybe over-commented with redundancy).  I used consistent naming conventions throughout and made sure that similar blocks of code looked the same throughout so that any other programmer could follow what I was doing.  I tried to keep the code as concise as possible for easier maintenance.
